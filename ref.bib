abstract = {Abstract Nanotechnology has the potential to transform EOR mechanisms and processes. At present there are two major nanotechnology paradigms derived from mechanical engineering and the biological sciences perspectives. However, a new focus within nanotechnology is emerging which could be called geomimetics. We can define geomimetics as employing the principles of geosystems to create and develop new and novel processes and materials. In a wider sense this involves copying the principles of geosystems into technology to compliment the natural environment. This geomimetic perspective of nanotechnology incorporates the long and distinguished history of colloid and surface science that has underpinned oil recovery and EOR. We give a concise definition of nanotechnology and demonstrate how it is applicable to EOR. Through consideration of complexity and systems thinking, we develop a process based method of representing complicated phenomena to help identify the critical processes which control EOR. We construct a hierarchy from fundamental surface forces leading up to processes such as coalescence, phase swelling and film drainage. This hierarchy constitutes a mapping from fundamental molecular forces onto petroleum engineering concepts. In general this hierarchy is spatially-temporally ordered, although particular attention to the overall context and fluid / rock history is needed when mapping wetting and spreading phenomena. We identify critical processes and identify p},

abstract = {Abstract Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already screened for EOR processes, the main challenges such as low sweep efficiency, costly techniques, possible formation damages, transportation of huge amounts of EOR agents to the fields especially for offshore cases, analyzing micro-scale multi-phase flow in the rock to the large scale tests and the lack of analyzing tools in traditional experimental works, hinder the proposed EOR processes. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes, revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with old EOR techniques. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to release the trapped oil from the pore spaces in the order of 5 to 50 microns of tight oil formations. Laboratory tests using nanoparticles as the EOR agent, developing nano computational models to explore the surface properties and utilizing nano-scale analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mostly for nanoparticles distribution in the pore spaces and on the surfaces for wettability alteration studies are the main parts of this investigation},

abstract = {Molecular models of three amino-functionalized cubic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been studied at 293K using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These hybrid organic/inorganic systems were all based on the T8R8 form, but they differed by the end-groups of their organic pendant chains, i.e. either R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H5OH, R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H6 or R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H11. Model densities, volumes, cohesive energies, void spaces, X-ray diffractograms and intermolecular as well as intramolecular interactions were analysed. The differences in bulk and structural properties between both aromatic-based organic chains are fairly small, although the added hydroxyl groups bring additional cohesion by modifying the amide⋯amide H-bonding network. On the other hand, replacing an aromatic by a cyclohexyl ring leads to molecular disorder, larger POSS⋯POSS separations and a lower density. The pendant arms of the three POSS under study were found to be intertwined with a preference for intermolecular interactions because of steric considerations. Such an interdigitation also allowed for the parallel stacking of the ring end-groups at short distances, thus bringing extra cohesion to the systems. However, there was no evidence of long-range crystalline order.},

The kinetics parameters of the gelation reactions were determined using steady shear viscometry at temperatures of 80 to 130 °C. The addition of salts to the mixing water was found to increase the gelation time. On the other hand, higher polymer and cross-linker concentrations reduced the gelation time. The activation energy was found to be 118 kJ/mol in distilled water and decreased to 93 kJ/mol in seawater. The reaction orders were found to be first order with respect to both PAtBA and PEI. The effects of initial pH and contamination with iron(III) on the gelation time were also examined in detail. Recommendations for field application of this gelling system are given.},

@article{Idahosa2016,
abstract = {Laboratory core flood experiments were conducted at different flow rates with partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide (HPAM) oilfield Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) polymer and silica sand to investigate the polymer retention in porous media due to flow rate variation. Specifically, the double-polymer bank method was used in a new way to quantify and understand total incremental retention (both reversible and irreversible) induced by flow rate variation for HPAM polymers. Experimental results indicate that adsorption was the dominant retention mechanism. Further, the results obtained show that polymer adsorption was rate-dependent (i.e., as flow rate increased, adsorption increased), and that the adsorption was largely reversible with minimal incremental irreversible adsorption. It was also observed that flow rate impacted polymer inaccessible pore volume (IAPV) decreasing from 32{\%} to 15{\%} as flow rate increased from 0.8ml/min to 6.0ml/min. Finally, results from the study also give better insight into understanding HPAM flow-induced adsorption and their effect on permeability reduction processes.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment influencing the spatial and temporal potential for reproductive success of cod (Gadus morhua) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in the different spawning basins. Hence, to quantify stock and recruitment dynamics, it is necessary to resolve species-specific regional reproductive success in relation to size, structure, and distribution of the spawning stock. Furthermore, as species and fisheries interactions vary between areas, it is necessary to include these interactions on an area-specific basis. Therefore, area-disaggregated multispecies virtual population analyses (MSVPA) were performed for interacting species cod, herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat in the different subdivisions of the Central Baltic. The MSVPA runs revealed distinct spatial trends in population abundance, spawning biomass, recruitment, and predation-induced mortality. Results, when evaluated with respect to trends in population sizes from research surveys, were similar f...},

abstract = {Synthetic polymers are important in many branches of industry, for example in the packaging industry. However, they have an undesirable influence on the environment and cause problems with waste deposition and utilization. Thus, there is a tendency to substitute such polymers with polymers that undergo biodegradable processes. Increasing interest in applying polymers based on natural materials such as starch has been observed. This review describes biodegradation processes of xenobiotics such as aromatic compounds, plastics (PVA, polyesters, polyethylene, and nylon), and polymer blends (Starch/Polyethylene, Starch/Polyester, and Starch/PVA). Moreover, this review includes information about biodegradable polymers such as mixtures of synthetic polymers and substances that are easy digestible by microorganisms (chemically modified starch, starch-polymer composites, thermoplastic starch, and biodegradable packing materials), synthetic materials with groups susceptible to hydrolytic microbial attack (polycaprolactone), and biopolyesters (poly-$\beta$-hydroxyalkanoates). Production of this kind of material and introducing it to the market is important for the natural environmental. It may result in decreasing the volume of waste dumps.},

In this study, a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide-hexamine-hydroquinonegel is used for the development of polymer gel system. The experimental investigation demonstrates that the gelation time varies with polymer and crosslinker concentration and the temperature. The mathematical model is developed with the help of gelation kinetics of polymer gel and using Arrhenius equation, which relates the gelation time with polymer, crosslinker concentrations, and temperature. The developed model is solved with the help of multivariate regression method. It is observed in this study that the theoretical values of gelation time have good agreement with the experimental values.},

abstract = {Suspensions of nanometre-sized particles (nanofluids) are used in a variety of technological contexts. For example, their spreading and adhesion behaviour on solid surfaces can yield materials with desirable structural and optical properties1. Similarly, the spreading behaviour of nanofluids containing surfactant micelles has implications for soil remediation, oily soil removal, lubrication and enhanced oil recovery. But the well-established concepts of spreading and adhesion of simple liquids do not apply to nanofluids2,3,4,5,6,7. Theoretical investigations have suggested that a solid-like ordering of suspended spheres will occur in the confined three-phase contact region at the edge of the spreading fluid, becoming more disordered and fluid-like towards the bulk phase8,9. Calculations have also suggested that the pressure arising from such colloidal ordering in the confined region will enhance the spreading behaviour of nanofluids10,11. Here we use video microscopy to demonstrate both the two-dimensional crystal-like ordering of charged nanometre-sized polystyrene spheres in water, and the enhanced spreading dynamics of a micellar fluid, at the three-phase contact region. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for oily soil removal—detergency.},

abstract = {The application of nanotechnology in the oil and gas industry is on the rise as evidenced by the number of researches undertaken in the past few years. The quest to develop more game-changing technologies that can address the challenges currently facing the industry has spurred this growth. Several nanoparticles, of different sizes and at different concentrations, have been used in many investigations. In this work, the scope of the study covered the application of nanotechnology in drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids, oilwell cementing, enhanced oil recovery (which includes transport study, and foam and emulsion stability), corrosion inhibition, logging operations, formation fines control during production, heavy oil viscosity reduction, hydrocarbon detection, methane release from gas hydrates, and drag reduction in porous media. The observed challenges associated with the use of nanoparticles are their stability in a liquid medium and transportability in reservoir rocks. The addition of viscosifier was implemented by researchers to ensure stability, and also, surface-treated nanoparticles have been used to facilitate stability and transportability. For the purpose of achieving better performance or new application, studies on synergistic effects are suggested for investigation in future nanotechnology research. The resulting technology from the synergistic studies may reinforce the current and future nanotechnology applications in the oil and gas industry, especially for high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) applications. To date, majority of the oil and gas industry nanotechnology publications are reports of laboratory experimental work; therefore, more field trials are recommended for further advancement of nanotechnology in this industry. Usually, nanoparticles are expensive; so, it will be cost beneficial to use the lowest nanoparticles concentration possible while still achieving an acceptable level of a desired performance. Hence, optimization studies are also recommended for examination in future nanotechnology research.},

@book{Ficai2017,
abstract = {Nanostructures for Novel Therapy: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications focuses on the fabrication and characterization of therapeutic nanostructures, in particular, synthesis, design, and in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluation. The chapters provide a cogent overview of recent therapeutic applications of nanostructured materials that includes applications of nanostructured materials for wound healing in plastic surgery and stem cell therapy. The book explores the promise for more effective therapy through the use of nanostructured materials, while also assessing the challenges their use might pose from both an economic and medicinal point of view. This innovative look at how nanostructured materials are used in therapeutics will be of great benefit to researchers, providing a greater understanding of the different ways nanomaterials could improve medical treatment, along with a discussion of the obstacles that need to be overcome in order to guarantee widespread availability. Outlines how the characteristics of nanostructures made from different materials gives particular properties that can be successfully used in therapeuticsCompares the properties of different nanostructures, allowing medicinal chemists and engineers to select which are most appropriate for their needsHighlights new uses of nanostructures within the therapeutic field, enabling the discovery of new, more effective drugs.},
