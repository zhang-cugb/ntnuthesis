abstract = {Abstract Nanotechnology has the potential to transform EOR mechanisms and processes. At present there are two major nanotechnology paradigms derived from mechanical engineering and the biological sciences perspectives. However, a new focus within nanotechnology is emerging which could be called geomimetics. We can define geomimetics as employing the principles of geosystems to create and develop new and novel processes and materials. In a wider sense this involves copying the principles of geosystems into technology to compliment the natural environment. This geomimetic perspective of nanotechnology incorporates the long and distinguished history of colloid and surface science that has underpinned oil recovery and EOR. We give a concise definition of nanotechnology and demonstrate how it is applicable to EOR. Through consideration of complexity and systems thinking, we develop a process based method of representing complicated phenomena to help identify the critical processes which control EOR. We construct a hierarchy from fundamental surface forces leading up to processes such as coalescence, phase swelling and film drainage. This hierarchy constitutes a mapping from fundamental molecular forces onto petroleum engineering concepts. In general this hierarchy is spatially-temporally ordered, although particular attention to the overall context and fluid / rock history is needed when mapping wetting and spreading phenomena. We identify critical processes and identify p},

abstract = {Abstract Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already screened for EOR processes, the main challenges such as low sweep efficiency, costly techniques, possible formation damages, transportation of huge amounts of EOR agents to the fields especially for offshore cases, analyzing micro-scale multi-phase flow in the rock to the large scale tests and the lack of analyzing tools in traditional experimental works, hinder the proposed EOR processes. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes, revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with old EOR techniques. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to release the trapped oil from the pore spaces in the order of 5 to 50 microns of tight oil formations. Laboratory tests using nanoparticles as the EOR agent, developing nano computational models to explore the surface properties and utilizing nano-scale analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mostly for nanoparticles distribution in the pore spaces and on the surfaces for wettability alteration studies are the main parts of this investigation},

abstract = {Molecular models of three amino-functionalized cubic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been studied at 293K using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These hybrid organic/inorganic systems were all based on the T8R8 form, but they differed by the end-groups of their organic pendant chains, i.e. either R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H5OH, R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H6 or R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H11. Model densities, volumes, cohesive energies, void spaces, X-ray diffractograms and intermolecular as well as intramolecular interactions were analysed. The differences in bulk and structural properties between both aromatic-based organic chains are fairly small, although the added hydroxyl groups bring additional cohesion by modifying the amide⋯amide H-bonding network. On the other hand, replacing an aromatic by a cyclohexyl ring leads to molecular disorder, larger POSS⋯POSS separations and a lower density. The pendant arms of the three POSS under study were found to be intertwined with a preference for intermolecular interactions because of steric considerations. Such an interdigitation also allowed for the parallel stacking of the ring end-groups at short distances, thus bringing extra cohesion to the systems. However, there was no evidence of long-range crystalline order.},

The kinetics parameters of the gelation reactions were determined using steady shear viscometry at temperatures of 80 to 130 °C. The addition of salts to the mixing water was found to increase the gelation time. On the other hand, higher polymer and cross-linker concentrations reduced the gelation time. The activation energy was found to be 118 kJ/mol in distilled water and decreased to 93 kJ/mol in seawater. The reaction orders were found to be first order with respect to both PAtBA and PEI. The effects of initial pH and contamination with iron(III) on the gelation time were also examined in detail. Recommendations for field application of this gelling system are given.},

@article{Idahosa2016,
abstract = {Laboratory core flood experiments were conducted at different flow rates with partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide (HPAM) oilfield Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) polymer and silica sand to investigate the polymer retention in porous media due to flow rate variation. Specifically, the double-polymer bank method was used in a new way to quantify and understand total incremental retention (both reversible and irreversible) induced by flow rate variation for HPAM polymers. Experimental results indicate that adsorption was the dominant retention mechanism. Further, the results obtained show that polymer adsorption was rate-dependent (i.e., as flow rate increased, adsorption increased), and that the adsorption was largely reversible with minimal incremental irreversible adsorption. It was also observed that flow rate impacted polymer inaccessible pore volume (IAPV) decreasing from 32{\%} to 15{\%} as flow rate increased from 0.8ml/min to 6.0ml/min. Finally, results from the study also give better insight into understanding HPAM flow-induced adsorption and their effect on permeability reduction processes.},
